                        <div>In Boston, just like in many other cities there is a constant, and difficult problem involving displaced persons and people suffering from financial, mental and physical issues. these issues are causing them to end up on the street in large numbers. In most, if not all of U.S. major cities, homelessness proves to be a ever growing crisis in urban America. 
                        However unlike most other cities boston is actually reducing its homelessness population according to this article titled; "As homelessness surges across the US after COVID pandemic, Boston has reduced people on the streets by 25%". <br><br> According to the article "housing-first" policies when dealing with the homelessness problem have proven effective, 
                        quote; "In Boston, the number of people sleeping on the streets and in shelters has dropped 25% over two years as advocates focused on finding permanent housing for those on the streets the longest." This appears to be working as the city has been able to reduce the number of homelss to about 6000 people down 25% since 2020.<br> <br> <a href="https://www.masslive.com/boston/2022/10/as-homelessness-surges-across-the-us-after-covid-pandemic-boston-has-reduced-people-on-the-streets-by-25.html">Click here to read the rest of the article.</a>
